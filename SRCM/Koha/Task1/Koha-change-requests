FEB-18th:
	- Need to have search option based on language type of book written. e.g if a book is written in kannada, if language criteria is selected, search for a book in that language need to be done.
	search logic should be based on 
		a.) First check Language code (041), if not defined/empty, then check below values
		b.) 008  ? - FIXED-LENGTH DATA ELEMENTS--GENERAL INFORMATION (field 27 to 30 character position) For e.g. if und is mentioned, it means language is not defined.
		c.) Language of a work entry?

Clue: opac-search.pl, prog/en/includes/masthead.inc
changed the masthead.inc code to support language search option. but the search works only if the Language Code is present  041 ##;  

Todo: Support the search based on the language 008 (35-37 bits) and also check the 100 field of marcview. Trying to enable the logger;
Completed - 8th March, except porting to original server;

Task2: 
	- Need to provide search summary for books which are available more than one copy. i.e Search should not show more copies of same book title & author, but just one instance with as many copies.

Refer sites about the background knowledge on koha search: zebra
http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Search_Info
http://www.len.ro/work/koha-search-2/

check below fields if duplicate copy;
100    $a Ingham,  Eunice D 
245    $a Stories the Feet Can Tell $c  Eunice D Ingham $b Stepping to Better Health
250    $b 65th Printing
260    $b Eunice D Ingham  $a Rochester N Y $c c1966

Fix/changes went into following files:

1.) Availablecount in template (opac-result.tt) from available_item.loo.count(); line 469;
2.) FindDuplicate function added to search.pm; also refer filter_duplicate;
3.) Under opac-search.pl @line 529/530

There are improvements need to be discussed; Present solution is temporary;
Also refer duplicatefinder.tt and duplicatesearch.tt files in recent git source Bug6813.
